# Machine-learning
### If you are seeking for learning Machine learning (ML), this repository is your way to be an expert in ML and data science. This repository assumes you don't know ML algorithms, python or statistics. As it will provide you with all tools and principles to become a ML expert. 

### Note that each part contains a subfolder named Dataset and ppt which contains the used datasets and ppt for that part.

# This repository consists of four parts

  # 1.  Python: 
                          
          Offers a basics for 
                          1. python language (plotting, read CSV files)
                          2. basiscs knowledge required for working with ML algorithms.


  # 2.  Data: 
  
           In this part we will present:
                          1. how can we understand our data usig statistcs
                          2. how to prepare data for ML applying,applying feature selection 
                          3. Different types of evaluation metrices used for ML.


  # 3.  ML algorithms: 
                           
                           1. Explains different types of ML algorithms
                           
                           2. Optimization in ML
                                          1. Gradient Descent
                                          2. Batch Gradient Descent
                                          3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
                           
                           3. Spot-check Classification & Regression algorithms (
                                    Starting with two linear machine learning algorithms:
                                            Logistic Regression.
                                            Linear Discriminant Analysis.
                                    Then looking at four nonlinear machine learning algorithms:
                                            k-Nearest Neighbors.
                                            Naive Bayes.
                                            Classification and Regression Trees.
                                            Support Vector Machines)
                                                    
                          4. Comparing ML Algorithms      
                                     
                          6. Improve Performance
                                          1.Ensemble Algorithms
                                          2.Algorithm Tuning
                                          3.Save and Load Machine Learning Models


  # 4.  Projects:
