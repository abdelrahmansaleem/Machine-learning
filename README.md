# Machine-learning


# This repository consists of four parts

  1.  Python: 
                          
           Offers a basics for 
                          1. python language (plotting, read CSV files)
                          2. basiscs knowledge required for working with Machine Learning (ML) algorithms.
  2.  Data: 
  
          In this part we will present:
                          1. how can we understand our data usig statistcs
                          2. how to prepare data for ML applying,applying feature selection 
                          3. Different types of evaluation metrices used for ML.
  3.  ML algorithms: 
                           
                           1. Explains different types of ML algorithms, 
                           
                           2. Optimization in ML
                                          1. Gradient Descent
                                          2. Batch Gradient Descent
                                          3. Stochastic Gradient Descent
                           
                           3. Spot-check Classification & Regression algorithms (
                                    Starting with two linear machine learning algorithms:
                                            Logistic Regression.
                                            Linear Discriminant Analysis.
                                    Then looking at four nonlinear machine learning algorithms:
                                            k-Nearest Neighbors.
                                            Naive Bayes.
                                            Classification and Regression Trees.
                                            Support Vector Machines)
                          
                          
                          4. Comparing ML Algorithms      
                                     
                          6. Improve Performance
                                          1.Ensemble Algorithms
                                          2.Algorithm Tuning
                                          3.Save and Load Machine Learning Models


  4.  Projects: 
          
          In this part you will apply all what you have been learned in all previous parts in real projects from start to end.
